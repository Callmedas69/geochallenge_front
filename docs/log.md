1. Keep the log

2. Still in Buy , After i sign a wallet to purchase , Buy modal / component (quantity , input field, and button is hidden) only left "Buy Booster Packs" and
"Select quantity and mint booster packs with ETH"

3. Instead showing that text , i prefer to show confirmation / waiting process, like "we are crafting your packs" are anything that sounds fun
